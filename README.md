## Why I Created This App
I was filling in on guitar for one band that was based out of Atlanta, GA. They were more established, had a few tours under their belt, and some momentum in the scene. They had booked a show at a venue in Nashville one night and we needed to get together that afternoon to run over the set. The normal rehearsal spot that I used was already booked that day and there was a scramble to find a suitable place for us to practice. I remembered there was an amazing rehearsal spot not too far from the venue. I gave them a call and it went straight to voicemail. It wasn't an office phone or anything...it was someone's personal cell phone. I had to wait for the person to give me a call back so I could confirm a time and room to book. Thankfully, we were able to secure the room, but I knew the process could have been much easier if they was an intuitive app that would allow me to do it all from my phone. When it came time to create an application for my server-side project, I knew exactly what to do! 

## The Tech
* C#
* ASP.NET MVC for the UI
* Entity Framework
* HTML5
* CSS
* Iconscout for various icons and images
* Font Awesome for additional icons

## Launching The App

Let's get the app set up first.

1. Clone the git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/kellycook301/finalCapstone
```

2. Run the project in the root directory
```
start RealRehearsalSpace.sln
```

Go ahead and create an account by clicking on "Register As A New User." Once you create an account you can go ahead and log into your page.
Here you will see a landing page. The calendar icon will let you book a room and the account icon will take you to your list of booked room. At first the list of your booked rooms will be blank. Let's change that!

## Booking A Room
To book your first room click on the calendar icon. You will be taken to a page where you may select a room that you want to book. After selecting a room you will be presented with a drop down menu asking for what time you would like to book. Times taken in that room by another user will not be present. After booking the room it will be added to your list of booked rooms! You may see the list by clicking on the account button in the bottom right-hand corner.

## Editing The Time
Let's say that you want to change the time you would like to be in the room. In the list of your booked rooms click on the "pencil" icon. You will be presented with a view where you can change and save the time. Once again, the times that are taken will not be listed.

## Cancelling A Session
Now let's say you would like to cancel that time altogether. In the list of your booked times, click on the "trash can" icon. You will be presented with a view asking if you would like to cancel. Confirm by selecting the "cancel session" button.

## The Process
Everything below details the process of how the app was created. The main piece of advice we got for the first capstone was to 
do something that we were passionate about. I was thinking of maybe tackling other things, but when I thought about what to,
a rehearsal space booking app was the one that made the most sense to me. There are great spots around town that do NOT have
a great way of booking a time and a room. My frustration with them was the main source of inspiration for Ensayar. Someone
came in before the final capstone sprint started and gave some great UI advice. I wanted the app to be simple and effective.
I wasn't planning on having a lot of bells and whistles. Ensayar is the result.

Projects that seem simple can be deceptively difficult. Even though I only had four tables in my ERD it still turned out to be
kind of a pain. I still felt a little hazy on C# so there was a hurdle to get over. But being thrown into the fire was a great way to HAVE to learn fast.

I knew that since Christmas break was quickly approaching and that I would have to juggle a LOT of family things around that time. So I made it my goal to complete the functionality before NSS would close for the break. Thankfully, the instructors were there to help me through my many rough patches. I completed the functionality on the last day. BIG WIN.

Over the break I did minimal styling. Once school opened back up I made sure to come in and start the daunting task of making the app actually look good. Turns out the amount of time I set for myself was more than enough. I love the creative part of styling so it was actually a lot of fun, even though I burned my eyes out and had to buy blue-refracting glass.

And here we are! All done. Very happy with the project even though there's some small stuff I wanted to have added. Here's some things I used in my project.


Shouts out to...
* My Cohort for always wanting to see me succeed and being all around awesome!
* My instructors Andy, Steve, Meg, and Kimmy! They were always willing to help when I was in a rut.
* Coffee for keeping me ENERGIZED.
* My my wife Jorden for believing me and always picking me up when I felt lost. My daughter Leven for being my main source of  drive and inspiration. My parents for always being there. Thank you thank you thank you!
